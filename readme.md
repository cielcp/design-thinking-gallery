## Description

This project is forked from (https://github.com/ClementCariou/virtual-art-gallery).

I am currently using this repo as part of a project for my Design Thinking course (https://arch20703070.cargo.site). This project will be exhibited at the UVA Architecture School's weekly series of Coffee + Community events, which was established after the tragic shooting on Nov 13th, 2022. These events aim to foster a sense of community and promote student wellbeing.

I have altered the original code to display submitted work from A School students, include instructions for how to navigate the virtual space, and be mobile browser friendly.

Thank you again to Clement Cariou for sharing a wonderful open source project.
